This project was completed as a part of Bangor University's Spring 2020 AI For Games course.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

This project aimed to showcase my understanding of various video game AI techniques in an interactive demo, including fleeing, player tracking, artificial tells, and random terrain generation. Additionally, creating the game in the Unity Game Engine required learning how to create digital assets in Adobe Photoshop, coding player and NPC capabilities in C#, and 

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Studying then subsequently implementing a code library to extend the functionality of my code. 
- Connecting interdisciplinary skills such as Adobe Photoshop and C# code required to create a singular product.
- Insights into making various AI principles seem realistic and believable to the player.
